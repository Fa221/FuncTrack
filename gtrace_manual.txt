Gtrace Manaul

Gtrace is a x86-64 tracing utility program for linux.
Gtrace outputs all system calls, library calls, and internal calls made
by a program at runtime. The output is a shown heirarchally to show
the caller callee relationship between functions. Functions arguements and
return values will be shown with the functions when output. If the number of 
arguements cannot be determined then Gtrace will output all six registers used 
to pass arguements on x86-64. If Dwarf debug information is available Gtrace will 
use this data to get the number of arguements and arguement names for functions.
This makes for a cleaner output.

Command Line Options
The following our the command line options for Gtrace.

--timestamps / -t : Provides a timestamp on each line of output
                    corresponding to the time the function being traced
                    was called.
--outfile / -o : Takes a file path as an arguement and outputs to the
                 given file instead of standard out.
--help / -h : Provides information on how to use the tool.
--aggressive / -a : Takes the number of bytes to dump for function arguements.
                    If a function arguement is a pointer then the provided number
                    of bytes will be read from the pointer and output in stdout.

Example:
    gtrace --outfile=trace.txt --timestamps --aggressive=64 ./hello_world
